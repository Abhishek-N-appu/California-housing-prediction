upload all notebook and datasets downloaded from this repository and run.
note:I used two models one is linear regression it gives rmse value 0 so, its overfitting 
second one is ramdomn forest it works well but since its a ensemble methods it takes a little time.
I used pipelines,one for transformation of data and one for scaling and training.
Thank you.
